Stone Oven is a free, plain-HTML website for a pizzeria. Open `index.html` and it works: no build step, no framework, no account. Edit the text in any editor and upload the folder to any web host.

## What's inside

- **Hero** — a photo of the wood fire, the opening days, and two calls to action
- **Specials** — three seasonal pizzas with price and tag
- **Menu** — three tabs (Pizzas, Starters, Drinks) with prices and dietary tags (vegan, spicy, chef's pick, new), plus the allergen note
- **Menu page** — the whole menu on one printable page
- **Order online** — a call-to-action band with a phone number
- **Hours** — a weekly table with the closed day marked
- **Our story** — the owner's story and a photo of a Margherita
- **Location** — address, directions link, phone, email, transit and parking notes, social links
- **Journal** — three posts and their pages
- **Contact** — a plain form that opens the visitor's email app (no back end)
- **Photo credits** — footer block, removable once you swap the photos
- **Schema.org JSON-LD** — `Restaurant`, `Menu` and the owner
- Self-hosted fonts, no trackers, no analytics, no external scripts.
- Works from `file://` and from any host or sub-folder: every link is relative.

## Quick start

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. That is the whole site.
3. Edit the `.html` files in a text editor and reload.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allanninal/stone-oven-html.git
cd stone-oven-html
open index.html        # macOS; on other systems double-click the file
```

## Customise

- **Text:** open the page (`index.html`, `menu/index.html`, `journal/index.html`, `contact/index.html`) and edit it. The business details in the demo (name, address, phone, email, hours, owner or chef) are made up; search for them and replace every one, including the `ld+json` block in `index.html`.
- **Colours and type:** the stylesheet in `assets/` (`index.*.css`) holds the colours as hex values. Search it for a colour and replace every match.
- **Photos:** replace the files in `images/` with your own, keeping the names or updating the pages. Then delete the `<details data-photo-credits>` block from the footer of each page.
- **Placeholder address:** the pages carry `https://example.com/` in the canonical and social-card tags. Replace it with your domain.
- **Contact form:** it has no back end. As shipped it opens the visitor's email app. To receive messages from the page itself, point the form's `action` at a form service (Formspree, Formspark, Web3Forms, Netlify Forms) and follow that service's instructions.

## Deploy

It is a folder of static files, so any static host works.

- **GitHub Pages:** Settings, Pages, deploy from a branch, `main`, `/ (root)`.
- **Netlify or Cloudflare Pages:** drag the folder in, or connect the repository. No build command; publish directory is the repository root.
- **Any web host:** upload the folder with FTP or your host's file manager.

Your scores will vary with your host and photos.

## Want it on WordPress?

Stone Oven is also a WordPress block theme: one click imports the demo, and everything stays editable in the editor. [Get the WordPress version](https://checkout.freemius.com/theme/43130/plan/75160/). The HTML edition here stays free either way.
